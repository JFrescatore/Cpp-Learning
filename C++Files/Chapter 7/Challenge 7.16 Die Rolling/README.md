**Challenge:**
>Write a program that simulates the rolling of two dice. The sum of the two values should then be calculated.

>Print the results in a tabular format. Also, determine if the totals are reasonable (i.e., there are six ways to roll a 7, so approximately one-sixth of all the rolls should be 7)
