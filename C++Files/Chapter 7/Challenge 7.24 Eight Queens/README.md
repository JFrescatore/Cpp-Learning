**Challenge Requirements:**

  >Another puzzle for chess buffs is the Eight Queens problem. Simply stated: Is it possible to place eight queens on an empty chessboard so that no queen is "attacking" i.e., no two queens are in the same row, the same column, or along the same diagonal?
  
  
 **Afterwards:**
 I used a more brute force approach, the approach just needs some minor tweaking and it can find every combination possible on the given board. However, I did not enable this as it was time to move onto the next challenge.
