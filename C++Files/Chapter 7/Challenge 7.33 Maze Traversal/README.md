**Challenge:**

>...Two-dimensional built-in array representation of a maze. In the two-dimensional built-in array, the hashes represent the walls of the maze and the dots represent the squares in the possible paths through the maze. Moves can be made only to a location in the built-in array that contains a dot. 

>Use recursion to have the computer travese through the maze.



**Afterwards:**

For some reason my Visual Studio is extremely touchy when it comes to vectors. Once I figured out how to safely handle vectors I was able to finally use a proper 2D array to handle this challenge, unlike the previous challenges in this chapter.
