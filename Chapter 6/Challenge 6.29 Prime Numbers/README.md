**Challenge:**

>An integer is said to be prime if it's divisible by only 1 and itself. Write a function that determines whether a number is prime. Use this functions in a program that determines and prints all the prime bumber between 2 and 10,000. 

**Afterward:**

Using modulo helped with this problem. Since we are looking for prime numbers the program will count up till the current number using modulo to test if there are no remainders, if there is no remainders a tally is added up. If more than 1 tallies are added up the number is not prime.
