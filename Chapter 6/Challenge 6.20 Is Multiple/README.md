**Challenge:**

>Write a function multiple that determines for a of integers whether the second is a multiple of the first the function should take two integer arguments and return true if the second is a multiple of the first, false otherwise. Use this function in a program that inputs a series of pairs of intergers.

**Afterwards:**

I used the function returning a true/false to write the numbers into a file listing all multiples of a number within a certain range.
