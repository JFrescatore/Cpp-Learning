**Challenge:**

>The process ends when the last task involved moving n = 1 disks. This task is accomplished by simply moving the disk, without the need for a temporary golding area. Write a program to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. Use a recursive function. Display the precise instructions for moving the disks from the starting peg to the destination peg.

**Afterwards:**

I learned the pattern needed to solve the problem but applying it to pure numbers took retooling of how I approach these problems. Also the process for solving even number of disks is the exact opposite of odd.
