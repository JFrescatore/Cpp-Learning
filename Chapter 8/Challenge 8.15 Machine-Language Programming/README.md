**Challenge:**

>This challenge will simulate machine language-programming. Create an array of 100. This array will be the computers "memory." Have an accumulator variable outside fo the array. The first operation will always be a write operation. Using the provided table, create three programs of differnt types.
<br><br>Programs to create are: <br>A) A sentinel controlled loop, the user will input positives numbers and the program will output the sum. Continue looping until a negative number is entered.
<br>B) Create a for loop, this loop will read 7 numbers, either positive or negative. Then it will display the average.
<br>C) Read a series of numbers and display the largest number. The first number inputed by user will be the amount of times the program will loop.
