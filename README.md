# Cpp-Learning

This repository is used for storing completed challenges from the "C++ How To Program," written by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel.

**Warning:**
Some programs could result in an 'index out of range' error when done inside of Visual Studios 2019. 
After testing, my personal Visual Studio will throw out the 'index out of range' error at anything that iterates more than 61 times, and is using a vector or array. Everything before and including Chapter 7 Challenge 7.22 was done inside 'repl.it' where they were tested and worked with no errors. All challenges up until Challenge 7.24 could cause this error.
